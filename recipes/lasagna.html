            Make this classic lasagna recipe zestier by using hot Italian sausage or a little milder with regular Italian sausage.
            Don't be scared off by the long cooking time. The wait is well worth it. 
            It's a great dish to make for a crowd and easy to adjust for varying tastes. 
            The leftovers are even better when reheated the next day.

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol></ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>
            Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. 
            Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. 
            Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>
        Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>
        Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer.
        Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles.
        Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
        Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese.
        Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>
        Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
